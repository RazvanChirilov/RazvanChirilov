I am interested in software development and I am very passionate about new techs.
Learning and always being up to date with new tech trends, I decided to make a change in my career to the IT area and for this path, I have been intensely preparing for more than 2 years and I am still learning and looking for opportunities.
I am learning and testing Python, Flask and Django Frameworks, MySQL, GIT @ Cisco Networking Academy and looking forward to NoSQL, MongoDB.
I am also familiar with web scrapping tools like Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Playwright and Scrapy framework, working on several projects in this regard.
