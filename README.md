I am a self-motivated and results-driven individual with a passion for new technologies, particularly in the field of software development. Over the past 1.5 years, I have actively prepared to transition into the field of information technology by staying current with new technological trends and gaining hands-on experience through self-learning and taking certified courses. My initial programming experience was self-taught using platforms like Codecademy and Coursera, and later, I completed a certified course in Python Fundamentals, OOP in Python, the Django framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS at the Cisco Networking Academy.
